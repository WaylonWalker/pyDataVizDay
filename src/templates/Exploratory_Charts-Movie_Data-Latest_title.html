<h2> Exploritory Analysis in Python </h2>
This page is a guest post by Suresh Aluru, created directly from a jupyter notebook.  This is a very powerful form of data visualization in python.It allows the user a platform for quick and easy iterations.  While exploring a dataset the plots and tables instantly come to life, withoutre-running the entire script.  It eliminates the need to setup any complexhtml css templates.  The notebook can be simply saved as an html file, then served from a simple web server or shared via a static html file.
